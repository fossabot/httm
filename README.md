# `httm`

*The dream of a CLI Time Machine is still alive with `httm`.*

`httm` prints the size, date and corresponding locations of available unique versions (deduplicated by modify time and size) of files residing on snapshots, but can also be used *interactively* to select and restore such files.  `httm` might change the way you use snapshots (because ZFS/btrfs aren't designed for finding for unique file versions) or the Time Machine concept (because `httm` is very fast!).

`httm` boasts an array of seductive features, like:

* Search for and recursively list all deleted files.  *Even browse files hidden behind deleted directories*.
* List file snapshots from *all* local pools (`httm` automatically detects local snapshots *as well as* locally replicated snapshots)!
* List file snapshots from remote backup pools (you may designate replicated remote snapshot directories).
* Supports ZFS and btrfs snapshots
* For use with even `rsync`-ed non-ZFS/btrfs local datasets (like ext4, APFS, or NTFS), not just ZFS/btrfs.
* Specify multiple files for lookup on different datasets
* 3 native interactive modes: browse, select and restore
* ANSI `ls` colors from your environment
* Non-blocking recursive directory walking (available in all interactive modes)
* Select from several formatting styles.  Parseable ... or not ...  oh my!

Use in combination with you favorite shell (hot keys!) for even more fun.

Inspired by the [findoid](https://github.com/jimsalterjrs/sanoid) script, [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) and many [zsh](https://www.zsh.org) key bindings.

## Install via Native Packages

For Debian-based and Redhat-based Linux distributions (like, Ubuntu or Fedora, etc.), check the [tagged releases](https://github.com/kimono-koans/httm/tags) for native packages for your distribution.  

You may also create and install your own native package from the latest sources, like so:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
cargo install cargo-deb 
git clone https://github.com/kimono-koans/httm.git
cd ./httm/; cargo deb
# to install on a Debian/Ubuntu-based system
dpkg -i ./target/debian/httm_*.deb
# or convert to RPM 
alien -r ./target/debian/httm_*.deb
# and install on a Redhat-based system
rpm -i ./httm_*.rpm
```

For Arch-based Linux distributions, you can create and install your own native package from the latest sources, like so:

```bash
# you need to edit the PKGBUILD as needed to conform to the latest release
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kimono-koans/httm/master/packaging/arch/PKGBUILD
makepkg -si
```

## Install via Source

The `httm` project contains only a few components:

1. The `httm` executable. To build and install:

    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh 
    cargo install httm
    ```
2. The optional `zsh` hot-key bindings: Use `ESC+s` to select snapshots filenames to be dropped to your command line (for instance after the `cat` command), or use `ESC+m` to browse for all of a file's snapshots. After you install the `httm` binary, to copy the hot key script to your home directory, and source that script within your `.zshrc`:

    ```bash
    httm --install-zsh-hot-keys
    ```
3. The optional `man` page: `cargo` has no native facilities for man page installation (though it may in the future!).  You can use `manpath` to see the various directories your system uses and decide which directory works best for you.  To install, just copy it to a directory in your `man` path, like so:

    ```bash
    cp ./httm/httm.1 /usr/local/share/man/man1/
    ```

### Caveats

Right now, you will need to use a Unix-ish-y Rust-supported platform to build and install (that is: Linux, Solaris/illumos, the BSDs, MacOS).  Note, your platform *does not* need to support ZFS/btrfs to use `httm`.  And there is no fundamental reason a non-interactive Windows version of `httm` could not be built, as it once did build, but Windows platform support is not a priority for me right now.  Contributions from users are, of course, very welcome.

On FreeBSD, after a fresh minimal install, the interactive modes may not render properly, see the linked [issue](https://github.com/kimono-koans/httm/issues/20) for the fix.

On some Linux distributions, which include old versions of `libc`, `cargo` may require building with `musl` instead, see the linked [issue](https://github.com/kimono-koans/httm/issues/17).

## Example Usage

Note: Users may need to use `sudo` (or equivalent) to view versions on btrfs datasets, as btrfs snapshots may require root permissions in order to be visible.

Print all unique versions of your history file:
```bash
httm ~/.histfile
```
Print all files on snapshots deleted from your home directory, recursive:
```bash
httm -d -R ~
```
Print all files on snapshots deleted from your home directory, recursive, newline delimited, piped to a `deleted-files.txt` file: 
```bash
# pseudo live file versions
httm -d -n -R --no-snap ~ > pseudo-live-versions.txt
# unique snapshot versions
httm -d -n -R --no-live ~ > deleted-unique-versions.txt
```
Browse all files in your home directory, recursively, and view unique versions on local snapshots:
```bash
httm -i -R ~
```
Browse all files deleted from your home directory, recursively, and view unique versions on all local and alternative replicated dataset snapshots:
```bash
httm -d only -i -a -R ~
```
Browse all files in your home directory, recursively, and view unique versions on local snapshots, to select and ultimately restore to your working directory:
```bash
httm -r -R ~
```
View unique versions of a file for recovery (shortcut, no need to browse a directory):
```bash
httm -r /var/log/samba/log.smbd
```
Recover the last-in-time unique file version (shortcut, no need to browse a directory or select from among other unique versions):
```bash
httm -l -r /var/log/samba/log.smbd
```
Snapshot the dataset upon which `/etc/samba/smb.conf` is located:
```bash
sudo httm -S /etc/samba/smb.conf
``` 
Browse all files, recursively, in a folder backed up via `rsync` to a remote share, and view unique versions on remote snapshots directly (only available for btrfs-snapper and ZFS datasets).  
```bash
# mount the share
open smb://<your name>@<your remote share>.local/Home
# execute httm
httm -i -R /Volumes/Home
```
Browse all files, recursively, in your MacOS home directory backed up via `rsync` to a ZFS/btrfs remote share, shared via `smbd`, and view unique versions on remote snapshots. Note: The difference from above is, here, you're browsing files from a "live" directory:
```bash
# mount the share
open smb://<your name>@<your remote share>.local/Home
# execute httm
httm -i -R --map-aliases /Users/<your name>:/Volumes/Home ~
```
View the differences between each unique snapshot version of the `httm` `man` page and each previous version:
```bash
filename="./httm/httm.1"
# previous version is unset
previous_version=""
for current_version in $(httm -n $filename); do
    # check if initial "last_version" needs to be set
    if [[ -z "$last_version"  ]]; then
        previous_version="$current_version"
        continue
    fi

    # check whether files differ (e.g. if current version is identical to previous version)
    if [[ ! -z "$( diff -q  "$previous_version" "$current_version" )" ]]; then
        # print that current version and previous version that differ
        diff -q  "$previous_version" "$current_version"
        # print the difference between that current version and previous_version
        diff "$previous_version" "$current_version"
    fi

    # set current_version to last_version
    previous_version="$current_version"
done
```
Create a simple `tar` archive of all unique versions of your `/var/log/syslog`:
```bash
httm -n /var/log/syslog | tar -zcvf all-versions-syslog.tar.gz -T -
```
Create a *kinda fancy* `tar` archive of all unique versions of your `/var/log/syslog`:
```bash
file="/var/log/syslog"
dir_name="${$(dirname $file)/\//}"
base_dir="$(basename $file)_all_versions"
# squash extra directories by "transforming" them to simply snapshot names 
httm -n "$file" | tar --transform="flags=r;s|$dir_name|$base_dir|" \
--transform="flags=r;s|.zfs/snapshot/||" --show-transformed-names \
-zcvf "all-versions-$(basename $file).tar.gz" -T  -
```
Create a *super fancy* `git` archive of all unique versions of `/var/log/syslog`:
```bash
# create variable for file name
file="/var/log/syslog"
# create git repo
mkdir ./archive-git; cd ./archive-git; git init
# copy each version to repo and commit after each copy
for version in $(httm -n $file); do
    cp "$version" ./
    git add "./$(basename $version)"
    git commit -m "httm commit from ZFS snapshot"
    # amend commit date to match snapshot modify time
    git commit --amend --no-edit --date "$(date -d "$(stat -c %y $version)")"
done
# create git tar.gz archive
tar -zcvf "../all-versions-$(basename $file).tar.gz" "./"
# and to view
git log --stat
```
